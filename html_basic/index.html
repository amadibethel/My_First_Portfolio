    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>

    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>This is a simple HTML page created as part of my web development learning journey. It's clean, minimal, and fully valid.</p>

    <h3>My Learning Experience</h3>
    <p>I've been learning about HTML tags, structure, and how browsers render content. This project helps reinforce those concepts.</p>

    <p>Semantic HTML makes web pages accessible and organized, which is important for both users and search engines.</p>

    <p>Eventually, I plan to use what Iâ€™ve learned here to build more complex pages with CSS and JavaScript.</p>
